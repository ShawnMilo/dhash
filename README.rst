``dhash`` is a self-contained (no dependencies outside standard library)
dhash creator. The dhash algorithm is fairly standard -- I tested the output
against the code from https://github.com/andybalholm/dhash/ and the result is the same.

The only reason I'm posting this is that it doesn't have any dependencies.
